Minesweeper Explained:

My process in developing this game:
I've really enjoyed learning coding by making games. I wanted to get a little deeper into the logic and minesweeper had a greater complexity then the other games upon which I had been working.

Technologies Used:
● ReactJS
● CSS3

Barriers to Development:
This project was more difficult than previous ones on several levels. The first big wall I hit was isolating the right click from the left. After spending a bit of time learning about click events, I spent another chunk of time understanding how to (in React) disable the onContextMenu. These were really good opportunities for me to understand both React and CSS a bit more! 

The next big barrier I came against was how to cascade open squares when a blank his clicked. I wanted to write code that used efficient but sound logic. 

I thought out the timer process a bit and initially wanted to do a very complicated one getting the date and doing math but realized all I need is a function that will count seconds so I wrote a counter and function that fires itself every second. This helped me understand how to write functions that call themselves and then how to stop that self-calling. 

This program is still not finished, but it is functional.

Refactoring:
I'm not quite done with this game yet, so I haven't done much refactoring, but I've got some ideas, expecially for when I implement levels with greater difficulty. I also need to implement the timer part of the game.
